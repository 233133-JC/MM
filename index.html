    <h1> Welcome to Movie Madness!</h1>
    <p>
  <br><br>
  Movie Madness was founded in 2008 by Daniel Muchenje due to his passion for media and movies.
  He  couldn't find anything that would allow him to watch his favourite movies and recieve information about them, so he thought he could do it better and decided to start a company.
  In 2013, Daniel finally moved his business from a small office in Chobham to a larger office on Farnborough Industrial Estate, which enabled Damiel to expand his business and increase the number of clients.
  As of 2019, Movie Madness Web works with multiple companies to provide you with the best experience possible.
  We have lots of information on more than 100,000 movies!
